|-----------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| V-222400  | High  | Validity periods must be verified on all application messages using WS-Security or SAML assertions.           | Not Applicable; Our implementation does not contain SOAP Capabilities.                                                      |
| V-222404  | High  | The application must use both the NotBefore and NotOnOrAfter elements or OneTimeUse element when using the Conditions element in a SAML assertion. | SAML is not utilized in our application, rendering the requirement for NotBefore, NotOnOrAfter, or OneTimeUse elements inapplicable. |
| V-222612  | High  | The application must not be vulnerable to overflow attacks.                                                   | Error handling and robust security measures have been implemented                                                            |
| V-222578  | High  | The application must destroy the session ID value and/or cookie on logoff or browser close.                   | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation.            |
| V-222430  | High  | The application must execute without excessive account permissions.                                           | The application is designed with minimal permission requirements, ensuring execution with only necessary privileges |
| V-222432  | High  | The application must enforce the limit of three consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a 15 minute time period. | The system does not support any login functionalities |
| V-222577  | High  | The application must not expose session IDs. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222609  | High  | The application must not be subject to input handling vulnerabilities. | Secure input validation and handling mechanisms are in place, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities. |
| V-222608  | High  | The application must not be vulnerable to XML-oriented attacks. | Not applicable; XML functionalities are not incorporated in our application, thus eliminating the risk of XML-oriented attacks. |
| V-222602  | High  | The application must protect from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. | DJANGO has security mechanisms to prevent this, and Implemented security measures safeguard against XSS vulnerabilities |
| V-222601  | High  | The application must not store sensitive information in hidden fields. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222607  | High  | The application must not be vulnerable to SQL Injection. | Not applicable; SQL functionalities are confined to the database layer, and there are no direct SQL interactions within the application's primary operations. |
| V-222604  | High  | The application must protect from command injection. | Not applicable, command injection vulnerabilities are outside the primary operational scope of the application, as command execution functionalities are limited to specific, controlled parts of the system. |
| V-222403  | High  | The application must use the NotOnOrAfter condition when using the SubjectConfirmation element in a SAML assertion. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222585  | High  | The application must fail to a secure state if system initialization fails, shutdown fails, or aborts fail. | The system is designed to fail securely in case of initialization or shutdown failures, as managed in main.py. |
| V-222550  | High  | The application, when utilizing PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222522  | High  | The application must uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users). | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222554  | High  | The application must not display passwords/PINs as clear text. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222596  | High  | The application must protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information. | We are utilizing AES_128 encryption to ensure confidentiality and integrity is maintained for all communication between LIDS/LNIDS Agents and LIDS-D server. |
| V-222399  | High  | Messages protected with WS_Security must use time stamps with creation and expiration times. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222658  | High  | All products must be supported by the vendor or the development team. | The development team expects the customer to provide continuous support and updates to provide for all software components, ensuring their reliability and security. |
| V-222659  | High  | The application must be decommissioned when maintenance or support is no longer available. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222551  | High  | The application, when using PKI-based authentication, must enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222620  | High  | Application web servers must be on a separate network segment from the application and database servers if it is a tiered application operating in the DoD DMZ. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222536  | High  | The application must enforce a minimum 15-character password length. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222643  | High  | The application must have the capability to mark sensitive/classified output when required. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222542  | High  | The application must only store cryptographic representations of passwords. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222543  | High  | The application must transmit only cryptographically-protected passwords. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222425  | High  | The application must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222642  | High  | The application must not contain embedded authentication data. | Not applicable; Embedded authentication data is not used in this application's implementation. |
| V-222662  | High  | Default passwords must be changed. | Not applicable; This requirement falls outside the scope of our application's implementation. |
| V-222555  | High  | The application must use mechanisms meeting the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module. | Safe encryption/decryption methods are implemented to meet authentication requirements to cryptographic modules. |
